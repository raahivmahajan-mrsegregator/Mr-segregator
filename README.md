🌱 Waste Segregation Website – 4 Stream System

This website is created to spread awareness about proper waste segregation and responsible waste management. The goal is to help people easily understand how to separate waste into four important streams to protect the environment and improve recycling.

The four waste streams are:

Dry Waste – paper, plastic, metal, glass, and recyclable materials

Wet Waste – food waste, kitchen waste, and biodegradable items

Sanitary Waste – diapers, sanitary pads, tissues, and hygiene waste

Special Care Waste –  batteries, bulbs, medicines, and hazardous items

By segregating waste correctly at the source, we can reduce pollution, support recycling, and keep our surroundings clean and healthy. This project encourages simple daily actions that can make a big difference for the planet 🌍♻️
